## Problem

Have you feel that typing message is too boring? Is it hard to express yourself through words when people can't see your face?

Communication should be dynamic and fun. Messaging should be more than just words. People should be laughing at messages rather than reading them dull.

##Solution

GifCom is a web chat application that allows users to open chat rooms and communicate in Gifs. This was my passion project at Dev Bootcamp and was also my first successful RESTful web application that was deployed to Heroku. The project was Integrated with Twilio and Giphy API.

Users are able to create or search for a chat, and add them into their list. The profile page shows a list of chat rooms that the user added.

Inside the chat room, users are able to chat in Gifs. The application will automatically search Gifs for you if there is a match.
